*Selectors
    A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

*We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

*The CSS element Selector
    The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
*The CSS id Selector
    The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
    The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

*The CSS class Selector
    The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

*The CSS Universal Selector
    The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

*The CSS Grouping Selector
    The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions. 

*When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

    External CSS
    Internal CSS
    Inline CSS

*External CSS
    With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

    Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.       

*Internal CSS
    An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

    The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

*Inline CSS
    An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

    To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

*Multiple Style Sheets
    If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.   
*inline style has higher priority as compare to internal and external      

*CSS Comments
    CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

*CSS Colors
    Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.  

    *An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
        RGB Value       In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:
        rgb(red, green, blue)
        Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
        For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
        To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
        To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).  
    *RGBA Value
    RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
        An RGBA color value is specified with:
        rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
        The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at al      

    *CSS HEX Colors
    A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.
        HEX Value
        In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:
        #rrggbb
        Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
        For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
        To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.
        To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.  

    3 Digit HEX Value
        Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.
        The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.
        The 3-digit hex code has the following form:
        #rgb
        Where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.
        The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.    

*CSS Backgrounds
    The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.
    In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:
        background-color
        background-image
        background-repeat
        background-attachment
        background-position
        background (shorthand property)

Opacity / Transparency
    The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:
 
*CSS Background Image
    CSS background-image
    The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.
By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

*CSS background-repeat
    By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.
    Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:
    If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;)
    To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;
    CSS background-repeat: no-repeat
    Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property

*CSS background-attachment
    The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):    

*CSS background - Shorthand property
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}
You can use the shorthand property background:

Example
Use the shorthand property to set the background properties in one declaration:

body {
  background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}
When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
