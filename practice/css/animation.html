<!-- these properties can be used to animate many CSS properties such as color,background-color,width,height,border-radius,etc.  -->

<!-- each animation needs to be defined with the @keyframes rule which is then called with the animation property.
Each @keyframe rule defines what should happen at specific moments during the animation where ,0% at the beginning
 of the animation and 100% at the end.
-->

<!-- syntax of animation
    @keyframes animation_name{
